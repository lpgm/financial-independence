					Financial independence - what it is, and how you can get it sooner
				</h1>
				<p>
					Most people achieve financial independence when they start to draw a
					pension. This normally coincides with getting older and retiring.
				</p>
				<p>
					But a few people manage to become financially independent earlier -
					sometimes a lot earlier. They can pay all their bills, and spend an
					amount of money they're comfortable with on top, for the rest of their
					lives, without having to do paid work.
				</p>
				<p>
					People who are financially independent have
					<a
						href="http://www.montanamoneyadventures.com/16-reasons-to-become-financially-independent/"
						target="_blank"
						>more options</a
					>. They can choose how much, or how little, paid work they want to do.
					They can do voluntary work instead. They can focus on their hobbies
					full-time, or take up new ones. Whatever they do, they can do it
					without having to worry about money. It's why financial independence
					is often called financial freedom.
				</p>
				<p>
					To become financially independent, should you not win, marry, or
					inherit money, you need to grow a big enough nest egg by
					<strong>earning</strong>, <strong>saving</strong>, and
					<strong>investing</strong>. It usually involves paying off all your
					debts, living well below your means, and saving much more than the
					norm.

					It's not unusual for people in the financial independence movement to
					have a saving rate of 50% or more - yes, they save at least half of
					their income. A few manage three-quarters or more.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a frugal lifestyle helps. This doesn't necessarily mean going
					without. But it does mean making better spending decisions and not
					throwing your money away. Most FIers prefer experiences to things, and
					tend to avoid buying 'stuff'.
				</p>
				<p>
					The biggest threat to saving is lifestyle creep - spending more as you
					earn more. If your income goes up, the trick is to carry on spending
					the same as before.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's the bottom line: the less you spend, the less money you need to
					accumulate. And the more you save, the faster you become financially
					independent.

				<p>
					Once you've started to save, the first thing to do is build up an
					'emergency fund' - a pot of cash you can get your hands on quickly if,
					for example, you lose your job. The second thing to do is start
					investing.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have to invest. You won't become financially independent by
					keeping all your money in the bank, especially today when interest
					rates are so low. If your money stays in cash, you risk not keeping up
					with inflation and running out of money.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are different things to invest in, but the basic rules of
					investing are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>spread the risk</li>
					<li>keep it simple, keep it cheap</li>
					<li>never be forced to sell when prices fall</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>
					At its simplest, your investment plan might be to buy one or two
					investment funds that track the movements of the world's stock
					markets. The prices of those funds will rise and fall each day,
					sometimes steeply. But the long-term trend of markets is up. So as
					long as you don't panic and sell when prices fall, your nest egg
					should grow over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are ways to try to 'beat the market' - to try to get a return
					that's higher than the market average. But many argue the market
					average is
					<a
						href="http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/solving-hard-problems-with-simple-ideas/"
						target="_blank"
						>good enough</a
					>, and that very few people can beat the market for more than just a
					short time.
				</p>

				<h3 id="risky">Is investing in the stock market risky?</h3>
				<div id="risky-box">
					<p>
						The answer is: it can be. But it really depends on what you mean by
						â€˜riskyâ€™. There are different types of risk, and there are ways to
						handle them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some investors describe themselves as â€˜risk averseâ€™; others are
						happy to buy â€˜high riskâ€™ investments. You're always told to invest
						according to your â€˜risk appetite/tolerance/profileâ€™. But what does
						all this talk of risk mean in practice?
					</p>
					<p>
						Many people define investment risk simply as â€˜price volatilityâ€™ - so
						they say an investmentâ€™s risky if its price moves up and down a lot.
						This is a reasonable starting point. If the price falls sharply just
						before you need to take some money out - ouch. Especially if youâ€™re
						about to put down a house deposit, or stop earning money. But if
						youâ€™ve got many years of investing ahead of you, a falling price is
						much less of a risk. The stock market as a whole goes up over time,
						so it shouldnâ€™t necessarily matter that it doesnâ€™t go up in a
						straight line (if you think about it, you should welcome falling
						prices in the early years with open arms).
					</p>
					<p>
						Letâ€™s use a wider definition for investment risk - letâ€™s simply call
						it â€˜losing moneyâ€™. There are three main ways* you can lose money
						when you invest.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Your investment becomes worthless one day, because, for example,
							the company you invested in goes under. Or your investment turns
							out to have been worthless from day one, because you were scammed.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price of your investment falls, and you actually sell it at a
							price thatâ€™s lower than the price you bought it at. This is the
							price volatility issue.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price of your investment goes up over time, but never enough
							to keep up with inflation. So when you sell, you get back more
							money than you put in, but its spending power has actually gone
							down. This way of losing money is often overlooked.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						So how do you reduce the risk in each of these situations? Itâ€™s
						actually quite straightforward.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket - spread the risk. This
							means not putting all your money into one company, or even one
							sector or one country. And try not to get scammed!
						</li>
						<li>
							Never be forced to sell when prices fall, potentially turning a
							paper loss into a real one. This means having enough cash, or
							something similar to it, easily available when you need it.
						</li>
						<li>
							Donâ€™t keep <em>all</em> your money in cash or bonds if you need it
							to last a long time. This means owning shares, so you beat
							inflation.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						So <em>how you invest</em> determines the risk as much as
						<em>what you invest in</em>. Thatâ€™s why you need to question
						oversimplified statements like â€˜the stock market is a casinoâ€™, or
						â€˜bonds are safer than sharesâ€™. Yes, day trading is akin to gambling,
						and bonds tend to be less volatile than shares. But thatâ€™s not the
						whole story.
					</p>
					<p>
						(*) There are other ways to lose money too. First, even if the price
						of your investment goes up over time, charges and taxes will eat
						into your return. To deal with this, you should generally keep the
						cost of investing as low as possible, and use tax wrappers like a
						pension or an ISA. Second, if you pick a handful of stocks, or let a
						fund manager do it for you, you might end up doing worse than the
						market as a whole. This is the, often-heated, debate around 'active'
						investing versus 'passive' investing.
